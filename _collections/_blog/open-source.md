## What is Open Source Software

Open Source Software(OSS) is distributed along with its source code. Users can inspect, modify, and improve the software however they see fit. From a developer's perspective, any dev can collaborate on development and contribute to the improvement of the software.

## Why is Open Source Software Important

OSS is important because it allows developers worldwide to collaborate and contribute to projects they are interested in and care about. Since anyone can contribute, OSS brings new perspectives and ideas to development that a single company or development team could not provide independently. These new perspectives lead to improved security and increased speed of debugging. OSS also provides students and new developers with tools to study source code and learn from various software. Lastly, OSS allows the public to comb through the source code and understand it, breeds public trust in the software.

## What is My interest in Open Source Software

I'm interested in OSS because I can study and work with many new technologies that fuel the software we use every day. It is also interesting to see how many of the programs we use daily are open-source. Contributing to a project or software millions use without working for a specific company is exciting.

## Examples of Open Source Softwares

* Python
  
  Python is a high-level open-source general-purpose programming language developed by Guido van Rossum in 1991â€”a modern programming language used for many things, such as creating websites.
