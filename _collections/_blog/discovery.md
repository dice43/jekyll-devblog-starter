## Challenges in finding open source projects

  Millions of open-source projects exist in the depths of Git Hub's many repositories. Picking out projects I found exciting and capable of contributing to was more challenging than I thought initially. Many popular projects had many contributors working on almost all of the current issues that the projects had available. Some projects had open issues, but as expected, issues that still need to be solved are relatively tricky. After hours of searching, however, I've found at least five projects that fit my criteria for a project I can and want to contribute to. 

## Projects that I wish to contribute to

### 1. [Mario-Level-1](https://github.com/justinmeister/Mario-Level-1)
